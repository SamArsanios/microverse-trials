              Martin Luther King, Jr., (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born
              Michael Luther King, Jr., but later had his name changed to
              Martin. His grandfather began the family’s long tenure as pastors
              of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to
              1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from
              1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin
              Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating
              from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A.
              degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro
              institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather
              had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer
              Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected
              president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded
              the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in
              graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence
              for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In
              Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon
              intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters
              were born into the family. <br /><br />

              In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue
              Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong worker for
              civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a
              member of the executive committee of the National Association for
              the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of its
              kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955,
              to accept the leadership of the first great Negro nonviolent
              demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus
              boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in
              honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted 382 days. On December
              21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had
              declared unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses,
              Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals. During these days of
              boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected
              to personal abuse, but at the same time he emerged as a Negro
              leader of the first rank. <br /><br />

              In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian
              Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new
              leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The
              ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its
              operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period
              between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and
              spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was
              injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books
              as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a massive
              protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the
              entire world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience.
              and inspiring his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail”, a manifesto of
              the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the
              registration of Negroes as voters; he directed the peaceful march
              on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his
              address, “l Have a Dream”, he conferred with President John F.
              Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was
              arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four
              times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named Man of the
              Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic
              leader of American blacks but also a world figure.<br /><br />

              At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the
              youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified
              of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize
              money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.
              On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of
              his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a
              protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that
              city, he was assassinated.
